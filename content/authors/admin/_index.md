Hsin Huei Chen is an undergrad researcher at the [Nelly Andarawis-Puri Lab](https://andarawispurilab.mae.cornell.edu/). Her research interests include biomechanics, mechanical design, and medical devices. At the NAP Lab, she is currently working on designing a 3D microtissue system to create artificial tendon, which can be used to conduct mechanical testing and elucidating cell matrix interactions during tendon healing. 

Outside of the lab, you can find her in the machine shop fabricating parts for her project team, Cornell Autonomous Sailboat or practicing diabolo (Chinese yoyo) with her team, the Pro-Yos.
