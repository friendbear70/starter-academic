I worked with another student to design a 3D cell-matrix strain device in AutoCAD. The device characterized the local micromechanical environment of tendon cells after cyclic loading. Simulating chronic tissue overuse, this ultimately provides insight into clinically relevant mechanisms facilitating effective tendon repair. This device was driven by two actuators that gripped the tendon to securely submerge it into different physiological test solutions.
