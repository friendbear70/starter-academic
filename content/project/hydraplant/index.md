Our team, Piqurious, is made up for 6 undergraduate students who were determined to design a product to "elevate the new normal". Although the world is largely shifting back to being in-person, a lot of office workers still opt for working at home. We found, through empathy fieldwork, that a lot of those who work from home (WFH) are not taking time for self care, especially doing the small things such as drinking water. 

Our product, the Hydraplant, aims to target that. We designed a mechanical plant that blooms as you drink water. Over time, if you forget to drink water, the plant begins to wilt, reminding you to drink water once again. By drinking water, the user would be boosting their mental and physical wellbeing. 

We hope that with this product, we can navigate a healthier and happier new normal.
