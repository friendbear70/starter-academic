For Mechancial Synthesis (MAE 2250) we had an original design project where the prompt was something for a hobby we wouldn’t try. My partner and I decided to create something that would simplify the set up for practicing and performing with the guzheng. (A 1.6m long, 21 string instrument) It’s so big and bulky, it usually requires two stands to hold the instrument up and a custom chair to match the height. 

We came up with the Protostand with 3 design choices in mind:
1. Adjustable: Using telescoping rods users are able to change the height and width of the stands or how far away the chair is
2. Portable: Everything is collapsible and fits into 1 bag, and everything should take as much time as a normal stand to set up, if not faster. The telescoping rods are aluminum so it’s light but sturdy. 
3. Comfortable: The chair would be made with a webbed mesh that has breathability and support, and allowing more adjustment would improve the posture of the player



*Note: as this protion of the project happened during the pandemic, only a paper prototype was able to be created.*
