Within the Andarawis-Puri group, I led an independent project by engineering a platform to investigate three-dimensional (3D) tendon cell behavior using complex imaging modalities. To accomplish this project, I designed and fabricated a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with the goal of embedding tendon cells within a collagen hydrogel. Over time, these cells will anchor to static posts that apply uniaxial tension, thereby creating an artificial tendon in a biomimetic mechanical environment. 

I presented my work in the 2021 Cornell Undergraduate Board Fall Forum, with my presentation winning the award for Excellent Explanation.
